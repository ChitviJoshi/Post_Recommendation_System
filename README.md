# Post Recommendation System

This repository contains a sophisticated post recommendation system designed to provide personalized content suggestions to users. The project leverages a hybrid recommendation model that combines content-based filtering, post popularity, and a unique "discovery" score to create a balanced and effective recommendation engine.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to recommend the top 3 posts for each user based on their profile interests, past engagement, and the attributes of the content. The system is designed not only to provide relevant recommendations but also to encourage user exploration and prevent the "filter bubble" effect.

This is achieved through a multi-faceted approach:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A deep dive into the dataset to understand user demographics, content types, and engagement patterns.
2.  **Model Exploration**: A comparative analysis of three different recommendation models: Content-Based Filtering, SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
3.  **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: A final, fine-tuned model that blends multiple recommendation strategies to provide the most relevant, popular, and novel suggestions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Personalized Recommendations**: The core of the system is its ability to tailor recommendations to each user's unique interests.
* **Hybrid Model**: The final model is a sophisticated blend of:
    * **Content-Based Filtering**: Using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to match user interests with post tags.
    * **Popularity Score**: Leveraging the engagement rate of posts to recommend trending content.
    * **Discovery Score**: A unique feature that encourages users to explore new topics beyond their stated interests.
* **User Segmentation**: The system includes an "exploration score" to segment users into categories like "Power Explorers" and "Loyal Fans," allowing for more targeted recommendation strategies in the future.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on key metrics like **Discovery Rate** and **Catalog Coverage**, providing a clear picture of its effectiveness.

## üìä The Datasets

The project utilizes three distinct datasets:

* **Users.csv**: Contains user information, including their ID, age, gender, top 3 interests, and a pre-calculated past engagement score.
* **Posts.csv**: Includes details about each post, such as its ID, the creator's ID, the content type (e.g., video, image), and a list of tags.
* **Engagements.csv**: A record of user-post interactions, indicating whether a user engaged with a post (1 for engagement, 0 for no engagement).

## üõ†Ô∏è The Recommendation Model

The final recommendation engine is a hybrid model that calculates a `final_score` for each potential user-post pair. The formula is as follows:

`final_score = (0.45 * content_score) + (0.35 * popularity_score) + (0.20 * discovery_score)`

* **`content_score`**: This is a measure of how well a post's tags match a user's interests. It is calculated using a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity.
* **`popularity_score`**: This score is based on the engagement rate of each post, giving a boost to content that is popular among all users.
* **`discovery_score`**: A unique and crucial component of the model. It measures the novelty of a post by calculating the proportion of its tags that are *new* to the user. This helps to introduce users to new topics and prevents their recommendations from becoming too narrow.

## üìà Evaluation & Results

The model's performance was evaluated on two key metrics that go beyond simple accuracy:

* **Discovery Rate (33.3%)**: This metric measures the percentage of recommended posts that fall outside a user's explicitly stated interests.
* **Catalog Coverage (77.0%)**: This represents the percentage of all available posts that are recommended to at least one user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ChitviJoshi/Post_Recommendation_System.git](https://github.com/ChitviJoshi/Post_Recommendation_System.git)
    ```
2.  **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Place the datasets (`Users.csv`, `Posts.csv`, `Engagements.csv`)** in the root directory of the project.
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the `Post_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook to see the full analysis and generate the recommendations.

## üîÆ Future Extensions

This project provides a strong foundation. Here are some potential extensions:

* **Collaborative Filtering**: Incorporate techniques to recommend posts based on the behavior of similar users.
* **Content Embeddings**: Use advanced NLP (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) for a more nuanced understanding of content similarity.
* **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust the scoring weights based on user segments (e.g., give "Power Explorers" a higher discovery weight).
* **A/B Testing**: Deploy the model in a live test to measure its impact on key business metrics like user engagement and retention.
